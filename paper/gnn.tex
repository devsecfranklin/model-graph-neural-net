\section{\label{sec:Graph}About Deep Learning/Graph Neural Networks}

\justifying
While an in depth explanation of graph theory is beyond the scope of this paper, some background
will be provided here to make the paper accessible to a wider audience. A collection of related references
will be included at the end of this paper for those who may be interested.

\section{\label{sec:collection}Gathering Data}

\justifying
Once a Terraform code base has been initialized, the user has the option to generate a directed graph of the infrastructure. Consider the following declaration of a Cloud Function for Google Cloud.

\begin{mybox}{\thetcbcounter: Terraform Declaration Example}
    \lstinputlisting{code/main.tf}
\end{mybox}

\justifying
\href{https://graphviz.org/}{Graphviz is open source graph visualization software}. Graph visualization is a way of representing
structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. DOT is a language used to describe graphs. Conversion of
Terraform HCL to a directed graph representation is trivial thanks to Graphviz and Dot.

\end{figure}

\justifying
Once our Terraform files have been output as a directed graph, we need to bring it in to Python so we can
perform operations on it. To run Terraform commands in an automated fashion, \href{https://pypi.org/project/python-terraform/}{the python-terraform module}
is used.

\justifying
Directed graphs are ingested into Python as an object using the networkx module. Now we are ready to
perform operations on the digraph, displayed in figure \ref{digraph}.

\end{figure}

\justifying
Note that new numerical labels are displayed in place of the original labels. These original labels are
stored in the node objects in case we need them later. The root node of the adjacency matrix is labeled
as the 0th element in the graph. Also of note is that the graphs displayed in figure \ref{pygraph} and figure \ref{digraph} can be described as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph\_isomorphism}{isomorphic}.

\subsection{\label{sec:adjacency}The Adjacency Matrix}

The adjacency matrix is a mathematical representation of our graph. The nodes are represented in a
columnar format known as a matrix. Continuing with our previous example, the representation of our

Assigning weights and features to the edges of the graph.
