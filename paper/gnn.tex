\section{\label{sec:Introduction}\mytitle}

\justifying
The Terraform software made by Hashicorp is typically used as a means of automating network infrastructure
deployments. Our teams produce Terraform modules and code frequently.

\section{\label{sec:Graph}About Graph Neural Networks}

\justifying
While an in depth explanation of graph neural networks is beyond the scope of this paper, some background will be provided here
to make the paper accessible to a wider audience.

\section{\label{sec:collection}Gathering Data}

\justifying
Once a Terraform code base has been initialized, the user has the option to generate a directed graph of the infrastructure. Consider the following declaration of a Cloud Function for Google Cloud.

\begin{mybox}{\thetcbcounter: Terraform Declaration Example}
    \lstinputlisting{code/main.tf}
\end{mybox}


\justifying
\href{https://graphviz.org/}{Graphviz is open source graph visualization software}. Graph visualization is a way of representing
structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. DOT is a language used to describe graphs. Conversion of
Terraform HCL to a directed graph representation is trivial thanks to Graphviz and Dot.

\section{\label{sec:preparation}Preparing Data}

\justifying
One our Terraform file has been output as a directed graph, we need to bring it in to Python so we can
perform operations on it. To run Terraform commands in an automated fashion, \href{https://pypi.org/project/python-terraform/}{the python-terraform module}
is used.
