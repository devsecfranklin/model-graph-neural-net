\begin{abstract}
Our teams rely heavily on the Terraform software made by Hashicorp as a means of automating network
infrastructure deployments in our labs and customer environments. Our teams also develop Open Source Terraform modules. These deployments and modules take the form of graph-structured data. This paper
describes efforts to apply Graph neural networks (GNNs), a form of deep learning, to perform analysis
of this infrastructure automation and determine the likelihood of computationally improving it.
